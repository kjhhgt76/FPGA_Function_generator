# FPGA_Function_generator
mini project for UST elec4320 course.

# Function description:

a.	For a given range, it produces sine or cosine or tangent values based on user choice. For instance, if the input range is [0, pi], and the user has selected sine wave, the output should be the repetitive values of sine wave in the interval [0, pi] with as small an interval between values as possible. Your design should be able to support a full wave i.e. the range [0, 2*pi].

b.	If the user chooses to generate a clock of frequency F, your code should generate that clock as output. You can restrict the range or values of F that a user can choose from.

c.	Your design should be able to generate a triangular wave of a given period and amplitude. You can restrict the user to select period and amplitude within a range.

d.	Your design should be able to generate a saw tooth wave of a given period and amplitude. You can restrict the user to select period and amplitude within a range.
